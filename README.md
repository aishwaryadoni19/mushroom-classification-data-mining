# 🍄 Mushroom Classification: A Data Mining Case Study in R

This project applies data mining techniques to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using decision tree models in R. Developed as part of the ALY6040 Data Mining course at Northeastern University, the analysis walks through data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
